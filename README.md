# Hi! My name is John Hamlin! 👋🏻

I build tools that make people's lives easier, most recently at **xkite**, where we created an open-source toolkit for **Apache Kafka** devs. xkite lets you spin up containerized Kafka clusters in minutes, run custom tests, and export your setup for deployment.

As a former journalist, I enjoy **writing documentation** that distills **complex topics** into **plain English**. As a senior comms consultant at North Carolina's largest county, I led **cross-functional teams of engineers** to craft **customer-focused** outreach and marketing campaigns.

When I’m not writing code, I’m a **bar trivia** champion, **hot sauce** masochist and **kombucha** home brewer. I'll talk your ear off about **reverse searing steaks**, the best way to make a **martini** (obviously gin, almost no vermouth) and the uselessness of the Oxford comma.

## Here's a look at what all I've been working on:
- 🪁 [xkite](https://github.com/oslabs-beta/xkite)
  - Open source GUI for Apache Kafka prototyping, testing and deployment. Spins up containerized Kafka clusters, runs custom tests, and exports configs for deployment
- 💼 [johnhaml.in](https://github.com/johnhamlin/johnhaml.in)
  - Your classic, over-engineered personal portfolio site, built from scratch with my favorite tools and a few I wanted to try out.
- 📼 [ScrewTapp](https://github.com/johnhamlin/screwtapp)
  - React Native App to Play DJ Screw Mixtapes on Archive.Org on iOS and Android
