### Hi there! üëãüèª

I build full stack apps. Currently, my favorite tools for the job are TypeScript, React, Next.js and Node, because they strike the right balance between development speed and scalability. Right now I'm working on xkite at the OS Labs tech accelerator, where we're building tools to make life easier for developers using Apache Kafka.

I enjoy writing documentation that distills complex topics into plain English. I've led cross-functional teams of engineers to craft customer-focused outreach and marketing campaigns. I honed my writing reporting for newspapers, where I covered everything from the local Ham & Yam Festival to global billion-dollar deals.

I‚Äôm a bar trivia champion, hot sauce connoisseur and kombucha home brewer. Not to toot my own horn, but I‚Äôve been known to solve a Saturday NYT crossword and I can reverse-sear a ribeye to perfection.

Here's a look at what all I've been working on:
