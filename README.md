### Hi there! 👋🏻

I'm a storyteller turned software developer. I know enough JavaScript, React, Node and SQL to be dangerous, and I'm learning more every day.

As a writer, I built a career translating complex topics into everyday language. In government communications, I loved finding ways to engage audiences with information that would improve their lives. As a newspaper reporter, I covered everything from the Ham & Yam Festival to Fortune 500 companies and future presidents.

Here's a look at what I've been working on:
