# Hi! My name is John Hamlin! 👋🏻

I build _full-stack web apps_ in **TypeScript**, **Go**, **React**, **Next.js** and **Node** and _cross-platform mobile apps_ in **React Native** and **Expo**.
I live in **Raleigh, North Carolina.**

I build apps that make people's lives easier. At **Deutsche Bank**, our team has used _React_, _TypeScript_, _GraphQL_ and _Redux_ to drive the development of a next-generation platform for onboarding investment banking clients using. By implementing modern functional React patterns, optimizing _Webpack_ and _Babel_ for faster load times, and leveraging AI tools like _GitHub CoPilot_, we’ve accelerated development cycles and enhanced user experiences. Migrating _Kubernetes microservices_ and _CI/CD pipelines_ to _Google Cloud_ has positioned the platform for scalability and innovation. 

As an **AI Consultant** at **FractionX**, we partner with mid-sized businesses to craft human-centric AI strategies, focusing on governance, cultural adoption, and tailored *AWS-based solutions*. Our consulting emphasizes seamless technology integration while addressing employee experience and organizational change. Passionate about bridging advanced technologies with practical applications, I aim to empower businesses to evolve through thoughtful AI adoption and robust cloud solutions.

When I’m not writing code, I’m a **bar trivia** champion, **hot sauce** daredevil and **kombucha** home brewer. I'll talk your ear off about **reverse searing steaks**, the best way to make a **martini** (obviously gin, almost no vermouth) and the uselessness of the Oxford comma.

## Here's a look at what all I've been working on:
- 🏦 [Deutsche Bank](https://www.db.com)
  - I average a dozen or so merged PRs a month at work, but the code is locked behind a GitHub Enterprise account.
- 💼 [johnhaml.in](https://github.com/johnhamlin/johnhaml.in)
  - Your classic, over-engineered personal portfolio site, built from scratch with my favorite tools and a few I wanted to try out.
- 📼 [ScrewTapp](https://github.com/johnhamlin/screwtapp)
  - React Native App to Play DJ Screw Mixtapes on Archive.Org on iOS and Android
- 🪁 [xkite](https://github.com/oslabs-beta/xkite)
  - Open source GUI for Apache Kafka prototyping, testing and deployment. Spins up containerized Kafka clusters, runs custom tests, and exports configs for deployment
